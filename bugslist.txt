Errors found:

At the root of all failed tests was enqueue. 
PeekFront and Dequeue only failed when more than one item was added to the list.
When testing enqueue, it was found that it failed to add to the back of the list and instead seemed to add to the front. 
This would make PeekFront appear wrong, and would make dqueue appear to remove from the back

it was also observed that there is a memory leak through running valgrind
